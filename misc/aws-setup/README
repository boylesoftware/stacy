The setup-aws.sh script can be used for automatic setup of some important parts
of the AWS infrastructure for Stacy using AWS CLI. The script creates and
configures:

- The Kinesis stream.
- The API Gateway resource.
- The IAM role used by Stacy.

The pre-requisites for the script include installed AWS CLI and a config.sh
file, which is included from the script and can be used to set and export some
environment variables (for example, to configure credentials for the AWS CLI).

The script does not perform a complete infrastructure setup. The setup must be
completed manually. Specifically, at least the following things must be taken
care of separately:

- In the API Gateway, the API keys and usage plans must be configured and the
  Stacy API needs to be deployed.
- Confirugration, state, and website content S3 buckets need to be created and
  access needs to be configured for the Stacy role.
- The Stacy Lambda function needs to be deployed.
- Website static content (images, CSS, etc.) needs to be uploaded into S3.
